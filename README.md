# Teamapt AIPM Reference Repo

This is the reference repository for the Teamapt AI-Powered Product Management (AIPM) onboarding process. It contains:

- **Six pre-defined capability anchors** — one per squad area
- **A worked example** — a complete Direct Debit subcapability, epic, and change spec
- **Blank templates** — copy these to start your own artifacts
- **Setup instructions** — see [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)

---

## Who this is for

Teamapt Associate Product Managers completing the AIPM onboarding sequence. You will fork this repo to your personal GitHub account and use it as the base for your own artifacts.

## Important naming note

The `TAPT` platform code is **temporary** and signals pre-platformisation. When Teamapt migrates to the Moniepoint GitHub org, capability IDs will be reassigned by the Head of Platform. Your artifacts will be migrated — not discarded.
