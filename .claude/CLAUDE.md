# AIPM Reference Repo — Claude Configuration

This repo is a Teamapt AIPM onboarding repository. It uses the PM Coaching plugin for
structured artifact creation.

- **Onboarding manager:** Idris Aliyu (ialiyu@teamapt.com)

- `subcapabilities/` — team-level subcapabilities (APM owns)
- `epics/` — epic and story files (APM owns)
- `release/` — change spec for the current working branch
- `templates/` — blank templates to copy

## Behaviour rules

- Capabilities in `capabilities/` are owned by the Head of Platform (Idris). Do not modify them without explicit approval.
- Each APM works only on their own subcapabilities and epics.
- Always run the pre-merge gate before committing an epic file.
- Jira sync flows Git to Jira — never edit Jira stories manually after sync.
- The `release/` folder on the main branch contains the worked example. On a working branch, it contains the APM's active change spec.

## Worked example

The full worked example lives on the `main` branch:
- `subcapabilities/SUBCAP-TAPT-DDBT-MAND.md` — Direct Debit Mandate Management
- `epics/EPIC-TAPT-DDBT-MAND-EP00001.md` — Mandate Creation and Activation
- `release/change-spec.md` — Change spec for the above
